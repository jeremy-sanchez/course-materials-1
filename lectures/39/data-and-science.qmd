1. Office hours as scheduled next week
2. Evening study session poll during RRR week
3. Survey

## Agenda

1. Critiquing and constructing claims with data
2. Two lessons from epidemiology
    1. Data: Cancer in the water
    2. Science: Cholera in the water

# Claims with Data

**Data**

722 census-tracts in the SF Bay Area.

- 1000s of people per tract
- Many demographic variables available from census
- Researchers sampled water in each tract and measured asbestos

## The response variable

The researchers aimed to explain the cancer rate in each census tract.

$$\textrm{Obs}$$

They started with the observed number of cancers in each tract.

## The response variable

The researchers aimed to explain the cancer rate in each census tract.

$$\frac{\textrm{Obs}}{\textrm{Exp}}$$

They started with the observed number of cancers in each tract. Then they calculated how many they would expect in that tract by adjusting the national rate to the age and sex distribution of that tract and took the ratio of these two numbers.

## The response variable

The researchers aimed to explain the cancer rate in each census tract.

$$\log \left( \frac{\textrm{Obs}}{\textrm{Exp}} \right)$$

They started with the observed number of cancers in each tract. Then they calculated how many they would expect in that tract by adjusting the national rate to the age and sex distribution of that tract and took the ratio of these two numbers.  Then they took the natural log transform to account for a right skew.


## Building a regression model

## Building a regression model

\begin{align}
\widehat{\log \left( \frac{\textrm{Obs}}{\textrm{Exp}} \right)} &\sim b_0 + b_1 asbestos + b_2 income + \\
 & b_3 education + b_4 married + b_5 asbestos\_worker
\end{align}

> $b_1$ is "highly statistically significant" with p < 0.001.

- Without random assignment, difficult to address all confounders.
- Ecological inference is treacherous.
